# Weekly Blogs

## Week 1

The first week of class have helped me learn quite a bit about both the things I am familiar with and the things I am not. Just sitting in lecture, hearing terms like Internet Protocol and HTML made me realize that there is much to learn, and I am excited to do exactly that.
	The article that stuck out the most to me this week was “How to Build a Low-tech Internet” from Low-Tech Magazine. The idea of essentially simplifying internet solutions through low-tech systems is intriguing to me. This article talked about how long distance wifi could be a viable way to implement internet solutions particularly in rural areas. These ideas would be able to provide an internet connection to people in these rural areas using resources that are much more readily available than those needed for high tech solutions. The downsides that were detailed in this excerpt talked about the variability in bandwidth per user that would occur with these lower-tech solutions based on the bandwidth of the nodes and the number of users (How to Build a Low-tech Internet). I found it interesting the parallels drawn between the data mules of the past, and those that are relevant today. The mules of the past would physically transfer messages and information from place to place. In the context of this article, these “data mules” took the form of buses that would come through towns without extending internet connections. The information uploaded to the town server would be stored until the bus came through to receive the data and transport it out to wherever its final destination was. To me, this demonstrates that no matter how advanced our means of transferring data seem to get, in some ways, the tried and true methods will always remain a relevant and viable avenue. 
	In reading the Gillespie article, it became clear to me that I do not understand the vast majority of what goes into what we refer to as the Internet. This entity is profound, and this article discussed different things (I am not entirely sure of the correct way to refer to them) in relation to the idea of the end-to-end principle. A good amount of this article went over my head, but from what I can understand, this principle has long been a sort of standard, and it allows for data to be transferred quickly and without much, if any, change until it reaches its destination (Tarleton Gillespie). This article helped me to better understand the infrastructure of the systems that transport data.
	Reflecting on the articles this week, I learned that academic papers and articles pertaining to the topics in this class will be difficult to comprehend, as they refer to a space with which I am not particularly familiar. I will need to continue to focus to try and understand the material that is being presented, but look forward to learning from this experience. I am excited to continue to learn about the thing that runs the majority of my life, the Internet.
